Cannot uninstall 'entrypoints'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.
You are using pip version 10.0.1, however version 19.0.3 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
